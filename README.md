Calculates jump time and reduces the speed of the player for a more realistic feeling.\
This is something that's being used in a lot of **platformer** games. Very useful in:

- Advanced parkours that do not require the full jump.
- Jumping is needed, but not the full jump height.

## Settings

- `precise_jump.privilege_required`: Whether a privilege is required or not to perform precise jumps (`false` by default).

## To-do

- Make it a more smooth feeling when jumping.
- Probably adjust the velocity values.

## Installation

- Unzip the archive, rename the folder to `precise_jump` and
place it in `..minetest/mods/`

- GNU/Linux: If you use a system-wide installation place
    it in `~/.minetest/mods/`.

- If you only want this to be used in a single world, place
    the folder in `..worldmods/` in your world directory.
